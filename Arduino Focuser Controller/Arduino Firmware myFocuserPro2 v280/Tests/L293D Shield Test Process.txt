L293D Shield Plus Uno
Best way is to work through this in a logical systematic way, checking off each part one at a time

To do this we will use the latest firmware and the latest window app.

First some basic questions
1. What OS
2. Firmware rev (the .ino code) - it must be no changes made
3. Stepper motor connected, what type of stepper motor?
4. What ports (M3/M4) on the L293D shield do you have the motor wired to? A photo is helpful
5. What power voltage are you using for the stepper?
6. Is this power voltage connected to the EXTN PWR Connector? A photo is useful
(If you have a multimeter what is voltage measured at this EXTN PWR connector?
7. The PWR jumper on the L293D is in default position? A photo is useful

Please run test program for motor
BasicL293DTest.ino
Did this test pass?

Push Buttons working? If not, What was result of TestPB.ino ?

LCD Working? If not, What was result of TestLCDI2C.ino ?
If yes, what shows on the screen?
Can you change the LCD update rate using the windows app?
